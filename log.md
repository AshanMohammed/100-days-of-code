**Today's Progress**: Brushing up my Javascript Skills with Codeacademy, Learned to use Var, Let and Const

**Thoughts:** After working on running an agency and stuffs. I Finally decided to spend some time on my passion (Programming). I have commited learning to code, exploring new libraries and tools and techniques minimum 5 hours daily and 4 hours daily building apps and solutions using my programming skills. It's time to give life to my ideas and maybe change the world one day :).
